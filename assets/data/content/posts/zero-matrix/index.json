Each time we find such an element, we will set the row and column of this element to be zeros.</p>\n<p>However, this knee-jerk approach overlooks the problem with a single iteration on the matrix. As the iteration goes through the entire matrix, it will turn the row and column into zeros everytime it finds a zero element. Eventually, it will turn the entire matrix into zeros. To avoid that situation, we will need some sort of representation for the rows and columns that need to be set to zeros and then modify the input matrix based on that. </p>\n<p>We will first need to create a row array <code class=\"language-text\">row[M]</code> and a column array <code class=\"language-text\">column[N]</code> and initialize their values to something other than zeros. As we iterate through the input matrix and find each of the zero elements, we can store their rows and columns indexes by assigning zeros to the corresponding indexes in <code class=\"language-text\">row[M]</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">column[N]</code>, respectively. Then, we will iterate through the input matrix again with the intention to set the rows and columns of those corresponding indexes where <code class=\"language-text\">row[M]</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">column[N]</code> is zero.</p>\n","date":"29 April 2020","timeToRead":1}},"context":{}}
